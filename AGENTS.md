# AGENTS.md — tds-ext-template-pkg

The clone base for TDS frontend extensions. Read `tds-frontend-contract-pkg`'s AGENTS.md
first — extensions implement that contract. `tds-ext-time-tracker-pkg` is the worked
reference; this is the empty scaffold with the same shape + a rename checklist
(see README.md).

## Shape (identical to any extension)

- `src/index.ts` — the `defineExtension({...})` manifest.
- `pages/*.astro` / `widgets/*.astro` / `islands/*` — the route/widget/settings
  slots' entrypoints (package subpaths in `exports`).
- `php/src/*Module.php` — the backend `Module`.
- `php/db/migrations/*` — Phinx migrations, class names **prefixed with the
  module id** (in-process auto-migrator = one process = no name reuse) — and the
  **file name must map to the class** (`<version>_template_create_example.php` ⇒
  `TemplateCreateExample`), so the prefix goes first in both. A mismatch throws
  `Could not find class …` during the *scan* and aborts every extension's
  migrations, not just yours.
- `.github/workflows/*` — inline dual pipeline (phpunit + npm publish).

## Styling: use the shared primitives, never invent a class name

**An extension ships no CSS.** There is no stylesheet in this package and there
must not be one — every token and component comes from `tds-shared`, which the
product already installs (declared here as a **peer** dependency, the same
treatment astro and react get). The host renders this markup inside the `panel`
surface, so the geometry is already decided.

The scaffold's markup is the reference. Use exactly these:

| Slot | Class |
|---|---|
| page shell | `tds-page` + `tds-page__head` > `h1.tds-page__title` (+ `tds-page__lede`) |
| dashboard widget | `article.tds-widget` > `h3.tds-widget__title`, figure `tds-widget__metric` |
| settings slot | `div.tds-settings-section__body` |
| record list | `ul.tds-list` > `li.tds-list__row` |
| card / table / empty | `tds-card` · `tds-table` · `tds-empty` |
| button | `btn` + `btn-primary` / `-accent` / `-ghost` / `-danger` (**both** classes) |
| inline label | `chip` + `chip--{neutral,success,warning,danger,info,cat-*}` |
| block message | `tds-alert` (+ `--success` / `--warning` / `--danger`) |
| label + control | `tds-field-row` · toggle row `tds-toggle-row` |
| message thread | `tds-thread` > `tds-thread__item--own` / `--other` |
| loading | `<Spinner />` from `tds-shared/components` |
| destructive confirm | `<ConfirmDialog />` from `tds-shared/components` — **never `window.confirm()`** |

**Do not invent a bespoke BEM name for any of the above.** Every extension used to
carry its own (`page page--x`, `widget widget--x`, `settings-section--x`,
`widget__metric`, `danger`, `<p>Wird geladen …</p>`) and **none of them had a CSS
rule anywhere** — they were a contract of intent that nothing implemented, so
those regions rendered as raw unstyled HTML. Undoing that took a sweep across all
14 extensions.

Three traps, each of which shipped as a real bug:

- **Never interpolate a class name.** `` className={`chip chip--${status}`} ``
  fails twice over: Tailwind cannot statically extract it, and a value matching no
  variant renders an unstyled element. Map explicitly, with a fallback. When the
  value comes from the **database**, use `resolveChipVariant()` from
  `@tracht-digital-solutions/tds-shared/design` — it is guaranteed to return a
  class that exists. (`badge badge--${status}` shipped in two islands; `.badge`
  never existed at all.)
- **`.status-pill` is an inline label, not a banner.** For a block message use
  `.tds-alert`. A stretched `<p class="status-pill">` was the most common misuse
  in the platform, at 24 sites.
- **Call the API with `apiFetch`, NEVER a relative `fetch`.**

  ```tsx
  import { apiFetch } from "@tracht-digital-solutions/tds-shared/api";

  const api = apiFetch; // sends the session cookie, resolves the API base
  ```

  Every extension used to define its own
  `const api = (path, init) => fetch(path, { credentials: "include", ...init })`
  — with a **relative** path. In a product that resolves against the product's
  own static host, and its SPA fallback answers unknown paths with **200 +
  HTML**: `res.ok` is `true`, `res.json()` throws, and the usual
  `.catch(() => setRows([]))` renders a calm, permanent empty state. No error,
  no console warning. The contact inbox reported "Keine Anfragen." for months
  with the rows in the database. `apiFetch` resolves the base from
  `<meta name="tds-api-base">` (written by the frontend host) and also routes
  401s through the host's session backstop.

  A mocked-fetch test cannot catch a regression here — a relative path satisfies
  every behavioural assertion — so **assert the absolute host explicitly** in at
  least one test.
- **Report every mutation's outcome, and report it with a toast.**

  ```tsx
  import { toast } from "@tracht-digital-solutions/tds-shared/components";

  const res = await api("/thing", { method: "PUT", body });
  if (res.ok) toast.success("Gespeichert.");
  else toast.danger(`Speichern fehlgeschlagen (HTTP ${res.status}).`);
  ```

  Rules that come with it:
  - **Never `await` a mutation and drop the response.** That was the single most
    common defect across the extensions — a 403 looked exactly like success:
    the dialog closed, the draft cleared, the list reloaded, and the row was
    still there. Optimistic UI must also roll back on failure.
  - **Failure messages carry the HTTP status.** It is what separates "session
    expired" from "service down" in a bug report.
  - **Transient outcome → toast. Persistent state → in-flow `.tds-alert`.**
    Load failures, form validation and "X is not configured" hints stay in the
    flow — the first two name something to fix, the third names something an
    operator has to go and set. Anything the user must **read or copy** (a
    temporary password, a one-time link) never goes in a toast.
  - **Never mount a `ToastHost`.** The frontend host mounts the only one; a
    second would double every toast.
  - The banner that keeps only failures gets `.tds-alert--danger`; several
    extensions were rendering "Fehler: …" in the info hue.
- **A destructive action needs a `<ConfirmDialog>`, and it is controlled.** Park
  the target in state from the row button, and let the dialog perform the action;
  pass `busy` while the request is in flight so it cannot be double-submitted
  (blocking `window.confirm()` gave that away for free — a non-blocking dialog
  must do it explicitly). Auditing every `method: "DELETE"` against its gate
  found **only 3 of 10 destructive actions confirmed at all** — invoices,
  customers, blog posts, FAQ entries, docs and milestones each deleted on a
  single unguarded click. The missing gate, not the ugly native prompt, is the
  failure mode to watch for; grep `method: "DELETE"` when you add one.
- **A JSX comment cannot sit in an expression position** — not after `=> (`, not
  in a ternary branch, not in a `.map()` return. It is valid only as JSX
  *children*. Put the note above the `return`; otherwise the build fails with a
  bare `Expected ")"` pointing at the comment's own closing line. The same applies
  to multi-line `{/* … */}` in an `.astro` template body.

For a component's **internal** layout, reach for the generic primitives before
inventing anything: `.tds-stack` (+ `--tight` / `--loose`) for a vertical stack —
form bodies, detail panels, reply lists; `.tds-row` (+ `--between`) for a
wrapping horizontal row — header rows, filter bars, tab strips; `.tds-compose`
(+ `__actions`) for a reply box. Those three plus the existing `.tds-toolbar`
(action rows) and `.tds-marginalia`-style `.marginalia` (metadata and hint text)
absorbed 46 of the class names extensions had invented for exactly these shapes.

**~31 names across the platform legitimately stay bespoke** and are knowingly
unstyled — genuinely singular internals such as `cms-editor__blocks`,
`live-chat-settings__matrix`, `blog-editor__preview`, `api-wiki__routes`,
`time-tracker__timer`. If you add one, expect it to render on browser defaults
until someone gives it a rule; that is the accepted trade, not an oversight.
(`widget-slot__*` looks orphan but is styled by an inline `<style>` in the host's
dashboard page.)

## Conventions baked in (don't regress)

- Depends on the **published** `tds-frontend-contract` (`^0.2.0`), not a path link —
  npm from GitHub Packages (via `.npmrc` + `NPM_TOKEN`), Composer from the public
  VCS repo. No local path repo — Composer fatals on a missing path repo in CI, so
  extensions resolve the contract purely via VCS (a clone, not a sibling).
- CI installs with **`npm install --no-package-lock`** (win32 lockfile breaks the
  Linux runner) — never `npm ci` + a committed lockfile here.
- `PACKAGE_TOKEN` (a public-Packages-friendly PAT) both installs the contract and
  publishes this package; set `NPM_TOKEN` from it in CI.
- **The npm and Composer versions move independently** — bump `package.json` for
  a frontend-only change (markup, islands, styling) and `composer.json` only when
  the PHP `Module` actually changes. The pushed tag is the Composer release ref.
  Every extension in the platform has its npm version ahead of its Composer one
  for exactly this reason; an earlier revision of this file claimed they move "in
  lockstep", which no repo has ever done.
- Declares `tds-shared` as a **peer** dependency (`>=0.14.0`), like astro and
  react: the product installs it, and a second copy in the extension would mean
  two token sets. An extension that omits it still builds — the product's copy
  resolves — so the omission is invisible until someone installs the package
  standalone. Keep it declared.

## When cloned

Do the README rename checklist in full — a leftover `template`/`Template`/
`tds-ext-template-pkg` string will collide with this template or misresolve a
specifier. `composeExtensions` / `ModuleRegistry` hard-error on a duplicate id, so
a missed rename fails loudly at the host build rather than silently.

## Tests

```bash
npm run test:run    # vitest, 45 tests (jsdom per-file via a @vitest-environment docblock)
```

This repo is not a feature — it is the **clone base** for every new extension —
so the tests target a different risk from the other packages: not "does it
work" but **"does cloning it work"**.

- `tests/rename.test.ts` — the clone checklist, enforced. Every identifier,
  path and specifier must be spelled with the same `template` token, in a form
  a find/replace catches; the package name must match; and **nothing may be
  left over from a real extension** (a stray `lexware:read` or `/tickets` path
  here is copied silently into the next four extensions somebody starts). It
  also asserts the manifest still exercises **all six contribution slots** —
  the template doubles as the worked reference for `frontend-contract`, and a
  slot that quietly disappears is one the next author never learns exists.
  > The foreign-name check is scoped to ids/paths/specifiers, NOT the whole
  > manifest: nav `group` values are shared sidebar buckets ("tools",
  > "verwaltung", "work") that every extension legitimately reuses, and labels
  > are free German text.
- `islands/WidgetBody.test.tsx` — the placeholder must **hydrate** (a clone
  starts from something that demonstrably runs), keep the `.widget__metric`
  class the dashboard grid styles, and make **no network request** — a clone
  that leaves the placeholder in would hit a non-existent endpoint on every
  dashboard load.
- `src/index.test.ts` + `tests/packaging.test.ts` — the manifest as a product
  build sees it, and that every specifier resolves, is exported, and ships.

`tests/rename.test.ts` also pins the version to the **0.1.x** line: a clone
inherits it, and starting outside 0.1.x means the host's `^0.1.x` caret never
picks the new extension up.

Verified by mutation: 17 deliberate breakages introduced, 17 caught.

## Mobile layout

This package ships **no CSS**, so every layout decision is a shared class or a
Tailwind utility, and neither is checked by anything at runtime. Two rules:

- **A row of more than two things — or any row holding a full-width field —
  goes on `.tds-row`, `.tds-list__row` or `.tds-toolbar`.** All three wrap.
  A hand-rolled `flex` does not, and on a 375px screen the overflow is not
  even visible: `body { overflow-x: hidden }` clips it, so the content simply
  is not there.
- **A `<table>` needs `tds-table` and nothing else.** The primitive turns
  itself into a horizontal scroller below 40rem; an extra `overflow-x`
  wrapper or an inline style is redundant. A table with no focusable cell
  also needs `tabindex="0"` + `role="region"` + a label, or its scrollport
  cannot be reached by keyboard.

`npm run lint:primitives` enforces the class part of this (including a
`<table>` without `tds-table` and a flex/grid table cell, which silently
drops the cell out of the column algorithm). It is a **regex scan**, so a tag
name written inside a comment counts as markup — name elements in prose.
